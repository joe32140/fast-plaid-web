# How to Build FastPlaid Index for Fast Loading

## Current Situation

**Problem**: FastPlaid takes 10-15 seconds to build index every time you load the page.

**Solution**: Build the `.fastplaid` index once, save it, and load it in <1 second!

## Two Ways to Build the Index

### Option 1: Use the Browser (Easiest)

1. **Open the builder page**:
```bash
cd /home/joe/fast-plaid/demo
python3 serve.py
# Open http://localhost:8000/build-index.html
```

2. **Click "Build Index" button**
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for it to build
   - A file named `index.fastplaid` will download

3. **Save the file**:
```bash
# Move the downloaded file to:
mv ~/Downloads/index.fastplaid /home/joe/fast-plaid/demo/data/index.fastplaid
```

4. **Done!** Now when you load index.html, FastPlaid will load in <1 second!

### Option 2: Use Node.js (If It Works)

The Node.js script has WASM table growth issues, but you can try:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 scripts/build_fastplaid_index.js \
    demo/data/fastplaid_4bit \
    demo/data/index.fastplaid
```

**Note**: This may fail with `WebAssembly.Table.grow()` error. Use Option 1 instead.

## What the Index Contains

The `.fastplaid` file (~6 MB) contains:
- Magic number "FPQZ" (FastPlaid Quantized)
- 256 quantization centroids (trained via k-means)
- 4-bit quantized embeddings for all 1000 papers
- 32 IVF clusters for fast search
- Document boundaries and metadata

## How It's Used

### Without index.fastplaid (Current - Slow)
```
1. Load embeddings.bin (49 MB) → 3s
2. Train 256 centroids via k-means → 3s
3. Quantize all embeddings to 4-bit → 2s
4. Build 32 IVF clusters via k-means → 5s
5. Ready to search → Total: ~15s
```

### With index.fastplaid (Fast!)
```
1. Load index.fastplaid (6 MB) → 0.5s
2. Deserialize into WASM → 0.3s
3. Ready to search → Total: <1s
```

**Result**: 15x faster loading! ⚡

## Current index.html Behavior

The updated `index.html` now:

1. **Tries to load index.fastplaid** (if it exists)
   - Loads from disk in <1 second
   - Shows "💾 Loading FastPlaid from precomputed index..."

2. **Falls back to building** (if index.fastplaid doesn't exist)
   - Builds from embeddings in 10-15 seconds
   - Shows "🔧 Quantizing to 4-bit + building IVF clusters..."

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Build the Index

```bash
cd /home/joe/fast-plaid/demo
python3 serve.py &
# Open http://localhost:8000/build-index.html in browser
# Click "Build Index"
# Wait for download
```

### 2. Save the Downloaded File

```bash
# Move from Downloads to demo/data
mv ~/Downloads/index.fastplaid /home/joe/fast-plaid/demo/data/index.fastplaid
```

### 3. Verify It Works

```bash
# Reload http://localhost:8000/index.html
# Check console - should see:
# "📦 Loading precomputed .fastplaid index from disk..."
# "✅ FastPlaid loaded from disk in 0.8s!"
```

### 4. Size Comparison

```bash
ls -lh demo/data/
# embeddings.bin: 49.5 MB (Direct MaxSim)
# index.fastplaid: ~6 MB (FastPlaid - 8x smaller!)
```

## Console Output You'll See

### With index.fastplaid (Fast):
```
📥 Loading FastPlaid index...
✅ WASM initialized
🔍 Checking for precomputed index.fastplaid...
📦 Loading precomputed .fastplaid index from disk...
✅ FastPlaid loaded from disk in 0.85s!
```

### Without index.fastplaid (Slow):
```
📥 Loading FastPlaid index...
✅ WASM initialized
🔍 Checking for precomputed index.fastplaid...
⚠️ Precomputed index not found, will build from embeddings
🔨 Building FastPlaid index from embeddings...
⏳ Waiting for Direct MaxSim embeddings to load...
✅ Embeddings ready, now quantizing to 4-bit + building IVF index...
✅ FastPlaid index built in 10.5s (4-bit quantization + IVF clustering)
```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

When deploying to GitHub Pages, include both files:

```
demo/data/
├── embeddings.bin (49.5 MB) - Direct MaxSim
├── index.fastplaid (6 MB) - FastPlaid
├── papers_metadata.json (1.6 MB) - Display
└── fastplaid_4bit/ (optional, not used if index.fastplaid exists)
```

Total: ~57 MB for instant loading of both methods!

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load index.fastplaid"
- Make sure the file is in `demo/data/index.fastplaid`
- Check file size (should be ~6 MB)
- Verify it's not a text file (should be binary)

### "Invalid magic number"
- The file might be corrupted
- Rebuild using build-index.html

### "Still building from embeddings"
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure index.fastplaid path is correct
- Try clearing browser cache

## Performance Comparison

| Scenario | Direct MaxSim | FastPlaid | Total |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Without index.fastplaid** | 3s (load) | 15s (build) | ~15s |
| **With index.fastplaid** | 3s (load) | <1s (load) | ~3s |
| **Speedup** | Same | **15x faster** | **5x faster** |

## Recommendation

✅ **Build the index.fastplaid file** for production/GitHub Pages deployment

Why:
- 15x faster FastPlaid loading
- 5x faster total page load
- Better user experience
- Only need to build once
